1. EOQ model
. allowed to stock out
. excess demands are lost
. x: fraction of demand that is lost
. p: cost per each lost unit
. c: cost to order per each unit. We should consider c because some demands are lost.

Since it is EOQ model, suppose:
. L = 0
. Fixed   cost = K
. 
Basic EOQ model
$$
g(Q)={K\lambda \over Q}+h
$$ 

2. 
$$
\theta_t=min_{ab}
